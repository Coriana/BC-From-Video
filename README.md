# Behaviour cloning from video
This code is a shameless hack from the might work at OpenAI and their Video PreTraining (VPT) project.

Using their IDM agent this tool 'guesstimates' the keys/mouse motion in batches, then feeds to a behavior cloning system to try and replicate the style of play.

Currently it fails as I have yet to work out how to make the camera play nice.
